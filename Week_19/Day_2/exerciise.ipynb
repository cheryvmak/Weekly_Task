The amazing thing about Python is that you really can write an appli -\\ncation on one platform and use it on every other platform that you need to \\nsupport. Unlike the other programming languages that promised to provide \\nplatform independence, Python really does make that independence pos -\\nsible.',\n",
       "  'In this case, the promise is as good as the result you get. Python emphasizes code readability and a concise syntax that lets you write \\napplications using fewer lines of code than other programming languages \\nrequire. In addition, because of the way Python works, you find it used in all \\nsorts of fields that are filled with nonprogrammers. Some people view Python \\nas a scripted language, but it really is so much more.',\n",
